# Team 15's Weather App

##Synopsis

A weather application made by Team 15 of the CS2212 Introduction to Software Engineering course at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. 
Key Features: Current Weather View, Custom Weather View, My Locations List, Short-term Forecast, Long-term Forecast.

The program connects to the OpenWeatherMap api (http://openweathermap.org/api) and uses a  JSON library (http://www.json.org/)

##Installation

To install the program just download the jar file from the root directory of the repository. Make sure you have read/write privileges in the containing folder as the program will store user and weather data to the local drive.

##Build

A pom.xml file is included in the repository so that the program can be compiled using maven. 
If you wish to compile the program without maven there is a dependency for the Json.org library (http://www.json.org/) that will have to be resolved.

##Usage Example
